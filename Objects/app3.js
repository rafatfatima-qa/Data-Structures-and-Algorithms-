Suppose you have an array of objects:

  let books = [
{
      name: ‘The Lean Startup’,
      topics: [‘entrepreneurship’,’startups’],
    },
    {
      name: ‘War and Peace’,
      topics: [‘peace’, ‘politics’],
    }];

Now you need to print the name and topics separately, how would you do that?

  },
  {

//The Array.map() method calls the provided function once for each element in an array, in order.

// printing books separately
console.log("Books:"); 
books.map(bookNames);

// printing topics separately
console.log("\nTopics:");
